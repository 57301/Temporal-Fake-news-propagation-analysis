Requirements and Technologies Used in Temporal Fake News Propagation Analysis (ARIMA)

Technologies Used:
Python – Main language for analysis.
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – Used to execute and analyze the project.
Pandas – Data preprocessing and time-series manipulation.
NumPy – Numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization.
Datetime – Handling date and time formatting.
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) – Likely used for time-series forecasting, though not yet visible in the snippet.

Requirements (Dependencies Installed in Notebook)
No explicit installations (pip install) are mentioned in the first part of the notebook.
Assumes standard Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels if ARIMA is used).
                                   
Overview of Analysis:
Dataset Used: Reads Fake.csv, which contains fake news articles with timestamps.
Date Processing: Converts date column to datetime format, sorts data chronologically, and checks for null values.
Trend Analysis: Counts the number of fake news articles published daily.
Visualization: Uses a line plot to show the trend of fake news propagation over time.
