Requirements and Technologies Used in the Sentiment Analysis Project

Technologies Used:
Python – Primary programming language for analysis.
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – Used for running and analyzing the code.
Pandas – Data manipulation and processing.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – Specifically using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model for sentiment analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization.
Torch & Transformers – Although imported, they might not be actively used in the code snippet.
Datasets Library – Possibly used for handling additional datasets.

Requirements (Dependencies Installed in Notebook)

Overview of Analysis:
Dataset Used: The notebook processes a dataset (Fake.csv) containing text data.
Sentiment Analysis: Uses the VADER model to compute sentiment scores.
Sentiment Classification: Labels text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on sentiment scores.
Visualization: Generates a bar chart showing the distribution of sentiments.
